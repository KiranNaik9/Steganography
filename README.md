# Steganography
Steganography hides messages within images, making the message's existance itself concealed. It differs from encryption by focusing on invisibility, not scrambling the message content. This project created using Python and Tkinter GUI

# **Pre-requisites:**
1. Python
2. Open CV library

To install python, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install CV library, run below code in command prompt
```java
pip install opencv-python
```
or
```python
pip3 install opencv-python
```
Reference - https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

# Usage
**Encryption**
1. Run Stegno_Encrypt.py
2. Browse the image or enter complete path of image
3. Enter the message to encrypt and Password
4. Click on Encrypt (Output file will be saved as filename_EncryptedOutput.png)

**Decryption**
1. Run Stegno_Decrypt.py
2. Browse encrypted image or enter complete path of encrypted image
3. Enter password to decrypt
4. Click Decrypt

# **Encryption and Decrytion:**
For accessing both codes in one interface try **Stegno_Combined.py**
